reconstructing gene regulatory network using Bayesian structure learning method

In system biology, the graphic nature of Bayesian Network provides a qualitative explanation of pathways for many biological phenomena. The current study is interested in reconstructing a protein signaling pathway from both observed and synthesized data using Bayesian structure learning method and comparing several Bayesian learning algorithms implemented in R packages with a Metropolis-Hasting Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
