# ReconstructGRN
  In system biology, the graphic nature of Bayesian Network providesa qualitative explanation of pathways for many biological phenomena. The current studyis interested in reconstructing a protein signaling pathway from both observed and syn-thesized data using Bayesian structure learning method and comparing several Bayesianlearning algorithms implemented in R packages with a Metropolis-Hasting Markov ChainMonte Carlo algorithm.
